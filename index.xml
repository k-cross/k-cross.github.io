      <description>This site is designed to serve as a creative outlet for topics related to philosophy, physics, mathematics, computer science and their applications. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to encourage free thought.
The modern internet is not what it was originally envisioned to be. This is meant to serve as resistance to the normalcy and ease by which people give their data to platforms that exploit their use. Corporate clouds are the means by which third parties can restrict and control the flow of data.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer by trade with professional interests that span a variety of practical and academic fields, from woodworking to mathematics. As a computer scientist, the things that truly peak my interest are language and compiler design, distributed systems and algorithms. When I&amp;rsquo;m not working, I&amp;rsquo;m probably commuting. But when I&amp;rsquo;m not doing that either, I&amp;rsquo;m usually playing with my awesome daughter somewhere in the mountains or beach.</description>

      <title>Abstractions</title>

      <description>Foreword: the idea comes from Greg Young.
Correct abstractions in programming are hard to make for the future case. Often, not enough data is given at the start of a project and it&amp;rsquo;ll change in such a way that is no longer flexible with the current implementation strategy. So how then, should sustainable programs be built? Optimizing for code deletion is a large part of the answer, perhaps not a full one though.</description>
