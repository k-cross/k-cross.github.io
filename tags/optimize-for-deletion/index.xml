      <description>Foreword: the idea comes from Greg Young.
Correct abstractions in programming are hard to make for the future case. Often, not enough data is given at the start of a project and it&amp;rsquo;ll change in such a way that is no longer flexible with the current implementation strategy. So how then, should sustainable programs be built? Optimizing for code deletion is a large part of the answer, perhaps not a full one though.</description>
