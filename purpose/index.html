<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">Modus Operandi</div><div class="section" id="content"><p>This site is designed to serve as a creative outlet for topics related to philosophy, physics, mathematics, computer science and their applications.
It&rsquo;s aim is to encourage free thought.</p>

<p>The modern internet is not what it was originally envisioned to be.
This is meant to serve as resistance to the normalcy and ease by which people give their data to platforms that exploit their use.
Corporate <em>clouds</em> are the means by which third parties can <em>restrict and control</em> the flow of data.
This is where the freedoms of the internet are held hostage.
ISPs are necessary to create the networks required for fast and reliable communication for the foreseeable future.
The amount of coupling that&rsquo;s tied to cloud services and ISPs can be significantly reduced however.
The original purpose of the internet was to have a decentralized system in which to share information but it&rsquo;s become a place where few players control the flow of data and the format it&rsquo;s stored in, significantly raising the bar for innovative services to take hold at all layers of the network stack.</p>

<p>The volume and speed in which data flows has never been faster than any other time in history and will only continue to grow.
Mitigation strategies for data flows and formats should be thought of in order to keep liberties with the people that governments serve, rather than at the hands of corporations that governments utilize.
A good hard look as to what government&rsquo;s purpose is currently, what it should be, and how the current economics affect it need to be analyzed and discussed.
This is intended to be a place to facilitate useful discussion around topics that are core to free speech and liberty which utilize technology.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading the musings of a madman.
