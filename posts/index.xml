      <description>TLDR: Elixir is f*!#ing awesome!
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the luxury of programming with elixir for the last nine months. It&amp;rsquo;s been my first full-time experience utilizing a functional language in a non-academic setting. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, elixir is a new language built on top of the erlang VM. It looks similar to ruby, but behaves quite differently.
Coming from a c and python background, the language has been incredibly expressive, powerful, and different.</description>

      <description>Foreword: the idea comes from Greg Young.
Correct abstractions in programming are hard to make for the future case. Often, not enough data is given at the start of a project and it&amp;rsquo;ll change in such a way that is no longer flexible with the current implementation strategy. So how then, should sustainable programs be built? Optimizing for code deletion is a large part of the answer, perhaps not a full one though.</description>
