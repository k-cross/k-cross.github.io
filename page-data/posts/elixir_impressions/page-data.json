this.</p>\n<p>The language is still great for a large variety of use cases and there many things that make it a joy to work with.\nThe actor model is baked into the language itself and feels like it belongs directly in the language itself, unlike many actor frameworks in other languages.\nAt the end of the day, its possible to make any language work for the problem at hand.\nFor the majority of
