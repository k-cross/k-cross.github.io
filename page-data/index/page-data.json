I mean, ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù, who wouldn‚Äôt want that? It‚Äôs very vague though, so what does it mean? Was America ever great to begin with? What are the things that made it great? What are the things that made it not great? These are questions left unanswered and in many cases subjective. The most well defined of the bunch is the <em>what makes America not great</em> bit, where it‚Äôs placed countless blame on <em>others</em>. The actual things that are happening as President Trump and Mr. Musk enact their agendas is probably not what you voted for.</p>\n<p>Mr. Musk is treating the economy and government like a startup, with the idea that they will massively succeed if they pull on the right levers. What success looks like to a billionaire is not what success looks like to most other people who want to feed their families and have a decent life. Both Mr. Musk and President Trump also have largely failed in businesses. Tesla is seen as highly successful but it makes most of its revenue from massive subsidies granted by the government. In fact, they just cut off medicaid completely and added a line item to buy more armored Tesla‚Äôs for the government, all of which is being controlled by Elon Musk. There has been no bid, no process, just adjustments to spreadsheets that control the budget of what DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) is supposedly making more transparent and maintainable. Donald Trump‚Äôs businesses have been failures for a long time. Don‚Äôt take my word for it though, here are some other people who know far better than I do about the going ons right now.</p>\n<p>The economic agenda by President Trump is anything but a solid plan:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"bluesky-embed\" data-bluesky-uri=\"at://did:plc:rbffgd2zo6r7rmnklo2nlyy5/app.bsky.feed.post/3lhmal3vte22t\" data-bluesky-cid=\"bafyreia4jqktq3nackfgwlvt7jdguoerbjlixc6ff77e4byyhimhcmeium\"><p lang=\"en\">You can tell this is a well-thought-out and detailed trade policy strategy because they keep rewriting it every couple of days.<br><br><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rbffgd2zo6r7rmnklo2nlyy5/post/3lhmal3vte22t?ref_src=embed\">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Joey Politanoüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rbffgd2zo6r7rmnklo2nlyy5?ref_src=embed\">@josephpolitano.bsky.social</a>) <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rbffgd2zo6r7rmnklo2nlyy5/post/3lhmal3vte22t?ref_src=embed\">February 7, 2025 at 10:36 AM</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The cancellation of education contracts that collect data nation wide from schools that help plan how effective specific educational programs are.

They do what they want and being told <em>no</em> us an unacceptable outcome and when their plans fail, they blame others for not executing well enough.

The attacks on science are not new but they have grown to be more normal and persistent<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>DEI is actually a good thing that does not harm white people nor does it put unqualified people in jobs. It often puts piles of resumes or applicants on top of a pile for them to be considered first, instead of passed over. Because there are generally fewer applicants, it gives them a chance to be noticed. Depending on the system, if there is over-representation of a minority it can reshuffle the pile so that they‚Äôre included in the same stack. The US has seen DEI as a <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/\">strength</a>. DEI has given the US a competitive advantage where we get to repeatedly challenge the status quo and more rapidly iterate because we have a tighter feedback loop. Destroying these policies and making the US an undesirable place for anyone that‚Äôs not white is going to ruin us in so many ways it will be impossible to recover from. After WW2 the US was in a unique position as the only non-ruined mainland with the only atomic arsenal making it possible to create allies and friendships that would last and we‚Äôre in a real danger of losing those forever. Attacking the US saying it has <em>woke</em> agendas is not helpful, particularly when <em>woke</em> is left undefined and intentionally vague‚Äîleft as a word to invoke a negative connotation. What does it actually mean? This is why I believe we share more values with each other than we think.
